                                        <p>Corporality Focus is to define the market segments that are most attractive to pursue for your specific Product. Our Process is to implement the Product in desired markets. We need to start with market research, the market problems of these segments can be identified and scored. Product portfolio inventories your current market position if it is not a brand new product, and coverage across problems you have addressed through your value proposition evaluation is key to define the product success. The launch of the product will be pursued by following the market intent and demand.
